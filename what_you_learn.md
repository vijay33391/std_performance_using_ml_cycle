echo "# std_performance_using_ml_cycle" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"

git remote add origin https://github.com/vijay33391/std_performance_using_ml_cycle.git
git push -u origin main



Sure, these commands are used when setting up a new Git repository and pushing your local project to a remote repository (like GitHub). Here's what each command does:

1. **git init**:
   - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This creates a hidden `.git` directory where Git stores its metadata and configuration for version control.

2. **git add README.md**:
   - Adds the file `README.md` to the staging area. The staging area is where Git prepares changes to be committed (saved) to the repository.

3. **git commit -m "first commit"**:
   - Commits the staged changes to the local repository with a message `"first commit"`. This creates a snapshot of the current state of the project. It's a good practice to provide meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.

4. **git branch -M main**:
   - Renames the main branch to `main`. This is often done to align with newer conventions (instead of using `master` as the default branch name).

5. **git remote add origin https://github.com/vijay33391/std_performance.git**:
   - Sets the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed. `origin` is the conventional name for the remote repository, but you can choose a different name if needed. The URL provided is the address of your GitHub repository.

6. **git push -u origin main**:
   - Pushes the committed changes from your local `main` branch to the `main` branch of the remote repository (`origin` on GitHub). `-u` sets the upstream branch, so in the future, you can simply use `git push` without specifying the remote and branch.

In summary, these commands initialize a new Git repository, add and commit changes locally, set up the remote repository on GitHub, and push the local changes to GitHub. This sequence is typically used when starting a new project and wanting to track changes and collaborate using Git version control.
